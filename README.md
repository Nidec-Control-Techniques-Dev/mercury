A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Organizing a Flutter app directory effectively can significantly enhance the maintainability and scalability of your project. Based on the insights from the provided sources, there are two primary approaches to consider: Feature-first and Layer-first. Each has its benefits and is suited to different project scales and complexities.

Feature-first Approach
This approach organizes the project around the functional requirements of your app, focusing on features as the primary division. Each feature gets its own directory, which can then be subdivided into layers like presentation, domain, data, and application. This method is particularly useful for larger projects where features are well-defined and distinct. It helps in encapsulating all related code within a single feature directory, making it easier to manage and understand.

Here’s an example structure for a feature-first approach:

```
lib/
└── src/
    ├── features/
    │   ├── feature1/
    │   │   ├── presentation/
    │   │   ├── domain/
    │   │   ├── data/
    │   │   └── application/
    │   └── feature2/
    │       ├── presentation/
    │       ├── domain/
    │       ├── data/
    │       └── application/
    ├── common_widgets/
    ├── constants/
    ├── localization/
    ├── routing/
    └── utils/
```

In a well-structured Flutter application, the code is typically organized into several key layers: **Presentation**, **Domain**, **Data**, and **Application**. Each of these layers has distinct responsibilities, helping to maintain a clean and manageable codebase. Let's explore each of these layers in detail:

### Presentation Layer
- **Responsibilities**: This layer is responsible for rendering the user interface (UI) and interacting with user inputs. It displays the data to the user and sends user actions (events) to the business logic layer.
- **Components**: It often includes widgets and screens that make up the UI. The business logic part of this layer can be managed by state management solutions like `flutter_bloc`, which helps in separating the business logic from UI code, making the UI code simpler and focused only on presentation [1].

### Domain Layer
- **Responsibilities**: The domain layer acts as a central point that handles business logic and rules. It transforms or manipulates the data received from the Data layer into a format that can be used by the application more effectively.
- **Components**: This layer typically includes entities, models, and business logic that are crucial for the application's operations. It acts as a bridge between the Data layer and the Presentation layer, ensuring that the data is correctly processed before being presented [1].

### Data Layer
- **Responsibilities**: This layer is directly involved with handling data operations such as fetching data from networks (APIs), databases, or other data sources.
- **Components**: It includes APIs, database access logic, and data storage mechanisms. It's responsible for sending and receiving data from external sources and providing it to the Domain layer. This layer is often designed to be reusable and can be isolated in packages for use across different projects [1].

### Application Layer
- **Responsibilities**: Sometimes referred to as the Service Layer, it contains application-specific logic that isn't directly related to the presentation or the raw data handling. It orchestrates how data is passed between the Presentation and Data layers, often involving complex business logic that spans multiple data models or sources.
- **Components**: This layer might include services or managers that handle more complex operations or business rules that are not specific to the UI but are crucial for the application's workflows. It helps in keeping the business logic not directly related to the UI separate, making the code more modular and easier to manage [4].

Each of these layers plays a crucial role in ensuring that the application is well-organized, maintainable, and scalable. By adhering to this structured approach, developers can ensure that their application can grow and adapt to new requirements without becoming overly complex or difficult to manage.

## Basic Widgets Functions

- The Row widget is used to arrange its children horizontally.
